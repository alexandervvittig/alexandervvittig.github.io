A bit late to the party this year, but we're having the Advent Of Code going on again!

[Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

It's pretty neat, give it a try!
