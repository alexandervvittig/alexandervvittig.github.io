As we all probably did, I recently upgraded to Windows 10. I was really impressed with how greatly MSFT improved the search function from 7 to 8/8.1, however in Win10, the search function just did not work for me. Using some Google-FU, I was not alone and here is what I found it to fix it:

1.Â Kill the process &#8216;explorer.exe&#8217; (Run PowerShell -OR CMD as Admin)

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">taskkill /im explorer.exe /f</pre>

2. Navigate to this registry key, and DELETE it:
  
(I recommend using <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963880.aspx" target="_blank">REGJUMP</a>, it&#8217;s just sooo handy!)

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderTypes{ef87b4cb-f2ce-4785-8658-4ca6c63e38c6}\TopViews{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}`</pre>

3. Launch &#8216;explorer.exe&#8217; again
  
(You should find more stuff now, but still not all&#8230;)

4. Make sure the &#8216;Windows Search&#8217; service is running

5. Run the following PowerShell command:
  
(Re-install / build Cortana&#8230;)

<pre class="lang:ps decode:true ">Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</pre>

6. Last but not least, make sure your &#8220;Indexing Options&#8221; in the Control Panel are set correctly. I Made sure I selected the right disks and drives, and rebuild the index from scratch, that took a while&#8230;

7. Enjoy your working and fast search! :o)
