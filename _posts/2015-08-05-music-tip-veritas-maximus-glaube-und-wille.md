Looking for new music I stumbled over **Veritas Maximus** the new band of Kevin Russell who has quite an <span style="line-height: 1.5;">interesting&#8217; past.<br /> Not judging a book by its cover I like his voice and the new project, so I&#8217;d recommend have a look at them.<br /> </span>**[Schicksalsflügel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUHDMq2aA84)** would be my favorite song, but even if you don&#8217;t speak / understand German, the music speaks for itself.
