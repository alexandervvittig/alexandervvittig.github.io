      I hope you all have at least heard of <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com/" target="_blank">Spiceworks</a>, a free, simple yet powerful multi-user web application that allows you to inventory, monitor, report on and troubleshoot your network, run a help desk, and access a community of IT pros &#8211; all from one easy-to-use interface.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However to me, Spiceworks is more than that. Along with the Spiceworks &#8216;products&#8217; you also get access to the community, a home, a safe haven, a trading post for knowledge, skills and experience, a sometimes a lot of silliness&#8230; :o)

        At over 6 million IT pros strong, The Spiceworks Community&#8217;s a place where IT pros trade tech tips, show off their awesome projects, share real-world advice from the IT trenches… and have a laugh.

      Being around in the Spiceworks community for years, I only recently decided to actively participate in discussions, helping answering questions and testing applications.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I helped to Beta test the <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com/free-network-monitoring-management-software/" target="_blank">Spiceworks Network Monitoring Software</a> and the new (and at this time still work in progress?!) iOS Spiceworks App for iPhone, iPad, and iPad Touch, found bugs and helped to improve things.
