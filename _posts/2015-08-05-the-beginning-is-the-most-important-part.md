> &#8220;The beginning is the most important part [&#8230;]&#8221;

is a famous quote by Plato. However to be begin something you have to end something. I am going to part with my current employer and move on to bigger and better things. I appreciate the last 18 month that I was able to help you out and you were giving me the opportunity to grow.

This Friday, August 7th will be my last day. Goodbye!

Also looking forward my new opportunity starting Monday, August 10th. Looking forward to it!
