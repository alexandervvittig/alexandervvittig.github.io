Ever wished you could have multiple consoles and stuff open without carefully rearranging them and then the Windows dock features messes it up and yaddi yadda?

Well, I found a superb solution for that: [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)

The 2Â most handy commands you&#8217;ll need:

<pre class="lang:ps decode:true "># Split window horizontally:
powershell.exe -new_console:s

# Split window vertically:
powershell.exe -new_console:sV
</pre>

^ That is needed to create the Windows as you want. From there you can use them as regular console Windows. So handy!
