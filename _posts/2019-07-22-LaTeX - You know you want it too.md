Ever found yourself writing a lot of papers? 
You turned into a Word ninja because, well, you had to?
While Word is fantastic and super powerful, especially for research papers and if you frequently use a certain template, LaTeX might be a better option.
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

I shared my [APA TEMPLATE](https://github.com/alexandervvittig/APA_LaTeX) template here, it saves me a ton of time having to format things in Word over and over again.
