I have a home ISP and get every once a week or so a new external WAN IP.

It&#8217;s no problem but it makes RDPing a little difficult.

Options are <a href="https://dyn.com/dns/" target="_blank">DynDNS</a> or <a href="https://www.noip.com/" target="_blank">NoIP</a>, I however wanted something Powershell based.

I set it up as a scheduled task and run it once an hour. It will see if there is a new IP, if there is it&#8217;ll write it to a Dropbox file that I can access from my phone, so I&#8217;ll always know the current WAN IP.

<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">function get-exip {
$url = "http://checkip.dyndns.com"

$webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient

$IP = $webclient.DownloadString($url)

$Ip2 = $Ip.ToString()
$ip3 = $Ip2.Split(" ")
$ip4 = $ip3[5]
$ip5 = $ip4.replace("&lt;/body&gt;", "")
$FinalIPAddress = $ip5.replace("&lt;/html&gt;", "")
$IPnew = Get-Content -Path "C:\users\$ENV:USERNAME\Dropbox\Scripts\TEST\index.html"
}

if (!($FinalIPAddress -eq $IPnew)){
get-exip
}
</pre>
