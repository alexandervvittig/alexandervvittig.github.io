Foy my new work I have to get cozy with [Puppet](https://puppet.com/).
Puppet provides a great [learning VM](https://puppet.com/download-learning-vm), however it is in a OVA format, and I need it as a VHD so I can use it with Hyper-V in my homelab.

There are several ways and utilities to convert an OVA to VHD
 * [Like this for example](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/Microsoft_Platform_Guide/Hyper-V_Role/*_Convert_VMware_OVA_to_Hyper-V_Virtual_Hard_Disk_VHD)
 
That script however seems to be finniky at times, depending on the OVA file.
I found that the VirtualBox convert utility seems to work quote a bit easier and more reliable.

It's as easy as this:
1. Install VirtualBox (Just install the 'Virtual Application', no need for all the other stuff)
2. Extract the VMDK from the OVA (e.g. with 7-Zip)
3. Run this in an Admin CMD session:
```PowerShell
$VMDK = "c:\path\to\machine.vmdk"
$VHD  = "c:\path\to\machine.vhd" #the utility will create the VHD for you
& "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" clonemedium --format vhd $vmdk $VHD
```
And voila, you should have a VHD from the OVA that you can use in Hyper-V.

So yeah that was not enough to get it to work in Hyper-V after all. I ended up using the [StartWind v2v Converter](https://www.starwindsoftware.com/starwind-v2v-converter). 
After that the VM is still no happy, you have to start the vm in 'rescure mode' to get it to boot happily.
