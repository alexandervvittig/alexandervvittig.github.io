We have Â custom APP that is used internally only, and even though the UAC is disabled it was throwing this annoying error:

The fix is relatively easy, you just have to be cautious as it might cause potential harm.

1. Navigate to: (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963880.aspx" target="_blank">REGJUMP</a> is your best friend for that!)

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Associations</pre>

2. Add a new &#8216;String Value&#8217;, call it &#8216;LowRiskFileTypes&#8217; and give it the value &#8216;.exe&#8217;.
  
3. Make sure to remove the &#8216;.exe&#8217; from the &#8216;HighRiskFileTypes&#8217; list.
  
4. Reboot.

Again, the warning, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it poses extra risk</strong></span> as it **will not warn** when the user opens another &#8216;.exe&#8217; file. We have great backups, users only use the same apps and have no rights to install things, so I am comfortable applying it this way.
