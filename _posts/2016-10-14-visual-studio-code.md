Well, going forward, with the movement of PowerShell being Opensource, it seems the ISE is no longer going to be the &#8216;main&#8217; PowerShell development platform, but Visual Studio Code, which is a free, open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) code editor from Microsoft.

[Late last year ](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2015/11/16/announcing-powershell-language-support-for-visual-studio-code-and-more/) it was announced that VS Code would get Powershell support, which is pretty awesome as you can not develop and administer PowerShell task from your Linux or Mac machine. The only drawback to it is, PowerShell is limited to PowerShell Core. On the bright site, that is super as Nano server is using PowerShell core as well.
