Now we have CentOS 7 minimal installed and the IP configured, first thing we want to do is upgrade ( update + enable obsoletes processing during updates)

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">yum update && yum upgrade</pre>

If you find the prompt for  &#8216;Do you want to install those blah blah&#8217; annoying, do this:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">yum -y update && yum -y upgrade</pre>

It is however always a good idea to check and see what is actually getting updated.

Next we want to install telnet:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">yum install telnet -y</pre>
