So you&#8217;ve been working help-desk for a while and want to move on? What do you need? Right 2 things stand out, experience, be it hands on or in theory and the other thing is, well certifications to proof that knowledge.

<img class="size-full wp-image-292 alignleft" src="http://blog.vvittig.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cyb.png" alt="cyb" width="174" height="101" />I want to give here a quick shout out to [CYBRARY.](https://www.cybrary.it)

They offer free courses for Systems Administration, Network Administration and Cyber Security.

Here you can see their current <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/courses/" target="_blank">course catalog</a>.
  
I mean how cool is that? I remember when I started studying for exams classes and study material was far from free.

> We believe IT and Cyber Security training should be free, for everyone, forever. We believe that everyone, everywhere, deserves the OPPORTUNITY to learn, primarily because everyone is essentially forced to use internet enabled devices. However, we are not prepared to defend ourselves against the cyber threats that exist and are emerging. Join the free Cyber Security training revolution at Cybrary!

They also have a nice <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> and a pretty active <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/forums/" target="_blank">forum</a> with a lot of information about various certifications and current cyber security trends.

If you are looking for more information on a certain subject or you are currently studying for a certification, I definitely recommend checking Cybrary out.
