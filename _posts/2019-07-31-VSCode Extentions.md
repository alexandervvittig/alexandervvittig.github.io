We all know VSCode is super powerful and going forwward the new standard for PowerShell (and other things) development as it's light weight, open source and works across pretty much all platforms.

The base feature set is already amazing, but there are extensions that make VS Code even more powerful. I'm going to list here a few of the extensions I use

1. ms-vscode.powershell or just ```PowerShell```  
This is the official Microsoft PowerShell extensions, that enable VS Code to do all sorts PowerShell
2. CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer or just ```Bracket Pair Colorizer```  
As the name implies, it colorizes brackets and thus makes it easier tofind the corresponding open / closed / missing bracket
3. DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint or just ```markdownlint```  
I write a lot of documentation and readme files in MarkDown, so this liter is super helpful in writing MarkDown. Also the build in MarkDown preview in VS Code helps seeing issues quickly with the formatting, or the lack there of.
4. yzane.markdown-pdf or just ```Markdown PDF```  
This goes along with the MarkDown documentation and creates a pretty PDF out of your MarkDown file. Pretty handy!  
5. eamodio.gitlens or just ```GitLens - Git supercharged```  
This fantastic extension add a bunch of Git support and capability, very handy if you work a lot with Git.
6. johnpapa.vscode-peacock or just ```Peacock```  
Ever accidentally entered the wrong Workspace, let’s say PROD instead of Dev? With Peacock you can assign a color to your Workspaces (e.g. red for PROD and green for DEV), so you’ll notice immediately that you are in the wrong workspace.
7. Shan.code-settings-sync or just ```Settings Sync```  
Settings Sync creates a GIST that syncs your settings.json file. So if you run VS Code on multiple machines, your settings can always stay the same.
