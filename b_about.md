Well, hello there!

My name is Alex Wittig.

I am an IT Professional with 9+ years of Systems Administration, Networking and Virtualization experience.

From Karlsruhe Germany, I live now in the ‘valley’ in Phoenix, Arizona.

I am very passionate about technology and this blog is to share some of my thoughts, projects, achievements, common issues, scripts, recipes and ideas.

If you don’t find me tinkering on new things, I might be posting in the [Spiceworks Community](https://community.spiceworks.com/) or just riding my motorcycle.
